                ----------------------------------------

You need to configure some parameters to lmbench.  Once you have configured
these parameters, you may do multiple runs by saying

        "make rerun"

in the src subdirectory.

NOTICE: please do not have any other activity on the system if you can
help it.  Things like the second hand on your xclock or X perfmeters
are not so good when benchmarking.  In fact, X is not so good when
benchmarking.

=====================================================================

If you are running on an MP machine and you want to try running
multiple copies of lmbench in parallel, you can specify how many here.

Using this option will make the benchmark run 100x slower (sorry).

NOTE:  WARNING! This feature is experimental and many results are 
        known to be incorrect or random!

MULTIPLE COPIES [default 1]: 
=====================================================================

Options to control job placement
1) Allow scheduler to place jobs
2) Assign each benchmark process with any attendent child processes
   to its own processor
3) Assign each benchmark process with any attendent child processes
   to its own processor, except that it will be as far as possible
   from other processes
4) Assign each benchmark and attendent processes to their own
   processors
5) Assign each benchmark and attendent processes to their own
   processors, except that they will be as far as possible from
   each other and other processes
6) Custom placement: you assign each benchmark process with attendent
   child processes to processors
7) Custom placement: you assign each benchmark and attendent
   processes to processors

Note: some benchmarks, such as bw_pipe, create attendent child
processes for each benchmark process.  For example, bw_pipe
needs a second process to send data down the pipe to be read
by the benchmark process.  If you have three copies of the
benchmark process running, then you actually have six processes;
three attendent child processes sending data down the pipes and 
three benchmark processes reading data and doing the measurements.

Job placement selection [default 1]: 
=====================================================================

Hang on, we are calculating your timing granularity.
OK, it looks like you can time stuff down to 10000 usec resolution.

Hang on, we are calculating your timing overhead.
OK, it looks like your gettimeofday() costs 1 usecs.

Hang on, we are calculating your loop overhead.
OK, it looks like your benchmark loop costs 0.00363500 usecs.

=====================================================================

Several benchmarks operate on a range of memory.  This memory should be
sized such that it is at least 4 times as big as the external cache[s]
on your system.   It should be no more than 80% of your physical memory.

The bigger the range, the more accurate the results, but larger sizes
take somewhat longer to run the benchmark.

MB [default 103]: 
Checking to see if you have 103 MB; please wait for a moment...
98MB OK
98MB OK
98MB OK
Hang on, we are calculating your cache line size.
OK, it looks like your cache line is 32 bytes.

=====================================================================

lmbench measures a wide variety of system performance, and the full suite
of benchmarks can take a long time on some platforms.  Consequently, we
offer the capability to run only predefined subsets of benchmarks, one
for operating system specific benchmarks and one for hardware specific
benchmarks.  We also offer the option of running only selected benchmarks
which is useful during operating system development.

Please remember that if you intend to publish the results you either need
to do a full run or one of the predefined OS or hardware subsets.

SUBSET (ALL|HARWARE|OS|DEVELOPMENT) [default all]: 
=====================================================================

This benchmark measures, by default, memory latency for a number of
different strides.  That can take a long time and is most useful if you
are trying to figure out your cache line size or if your cache line size
is greater than 128 bytes.

If you are planning on sending in these results, please don't do a fast
run.

Answering yes means that we measure memory latency with a 128 byte stride.  

FASTMEM [default no]: 
=====================================================================

This benchmark measures, by default, file system latency.  That can
take a long time on systems with old style file systems (i.e., UFS,
FFS, etc.).  Linux' ext2fs and Sun's tmpfs are fast enough that this
test is not painful.

If you are planning on sending in these results, please don't do a fast
run.

If you want to skip the file system latency tests, answer "yes" below.

SLOWFS [default no]: 
=====================================================================

This benchmark can measure disk zone bandwidths and seek times.  These can
be turned into whizzy graphs that pretty much tell you everything you might
need to know about the performance of your disk.  

This takes a while and requires read access to a disk drive.  
Write is not measured, see disk.c to see how if you want to do so.

If you want to skip the disk tests, hit return below.

If you want to include disk tests, then specify the path to the disk
device, such as /dev/sda.  For each disk that is readable, you'll be
prompted for a one line description of the drive, i.e., 

        Iomega IDE ZIP
or
        HP C3725S 2GB on 10MB/sec NCR SCSI bus

DISKS [default none]: 
=====================================================================

If you are running on an idle network and there are other, identically
configured systems, on the same wire (no gateway between you and them),
and you have rsh access to them, then you should run the network part
of the benchmarks to them.  Please specify any such systems as a space
separated list such as: ether-host fddi-host hippi-host.

REMOTE [default none]: 
=====================================================================

Calculating mhz, please wait for a moment...
I think your CPU mhz is 

        550 MHz, 1.8182 nanosec clock

but I am frequently wrong.  If that is the wrong Mhz, type in your
    NUMBER:     2

    SPEED:      i.e, 60ns, 70ns, etc.                                      
    TYPE:       FPM, EDO, DIMM, etc
